# Taxi_Fare_Prediction
**Problem Statement**-NYC Taxi is one of the cab services in New York, which is growing rapidly online car rental and taxi hire companies in New York. To keep up the pace at which they are growing they have decided to optimize their pricing to gain a good customer base and stay competitive.Predict the optimized fare price: The system should be able to predict the competitive fare price depending on several factors. For example, during the peak hours, the prices of the fare should be comparatively high or if the travel is at night, then the night fares might apply. Other factors to consider are distance, weather, availability of cabs, etc. If the car is rented for >1 day, then the fare should be calculated accordingly.
